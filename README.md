# Ginnojo Tech Doc

This is my technical memorandum for setting up a multi-purpose (mainly web and mail) server from scratch using Debian 12 "Bookworm."

Currently, it's in the process of upgrading from the previous [Bullseye version](https://tech.ginnojo.jp/).
The current version on the GitHub Pages is available [here](https://yaws-k.github.io/ginnojo-tech-notes/). The URL will be changed to the production version when it's completed.
