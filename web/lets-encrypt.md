# Let's Encrypt

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) privides free SSL/TLS certificates. It also provides the official client "Certbot" to create, renew, and revoke certificates.

There are several ways to set up Certbot and plugins.

(1) Certbot only (snap)
If you don't need any plugins, installing Certbot with snap is the easiest way.  
In most cases "[webroot](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#webroot)" should work.

(2) Certbot and plugins that are available as snap apps (snap)
If you need DNS challenges and are using major DNS services (for example, Route53), you can use Certbot and plugins, both provided as snap apps.
Or, the required plugins are available as snap apps; you can install everything through the snap.
DNS challenges are required when you need a wildcard certificate or the web server is in an intranet behind the firewall.

(3) Certbot and third-party plugins that aren't available as snap app
If any required plugins are unavailable as snap apps, you need to install Certbot and plugins through Python pip. How to is explained in the [official explanation](https://certbot.eff.org/).

I used to use a wildcard certificate with Gandi LiveDNS (which requires the most complicated method), but with some tweaks with Nginx, I could manage certificates with Certbot only.

## Install snapd

See [snap official site Debian page](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-on-debian) for more details.

Install snapd to install snap apps.

```console
sudo apt install snapd
```

Log out and log in again, and install the latest snapd.

```console
sudo snap install snapd
```

## Install Certbot

Don't forget to add `--classic` option.

```console
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

Add certbot command to `/usr/bin/certbot`

```console
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

"webroot" doesn't require any plugins. Certbot itself is enough.

## Configure the site for http challenge

Certbot webroot check will make a file into `${webroot-path}/.well-known/acme-challenge/(random url)` and Let's Encrypt server checks if that file is accessible and correct.

For Let's Encrypt validator, make a dedicated directory.

```console
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/certbot/.well-known/acme-challenge
```

Add an exception to the current HTTP access redirect.  
This configuration will be used in multiple sites, so make it a snippet.

`/etc/nginx/snippets/certbot.conf`

```nginx
# Add root directory
root /var/www/certbot;

# Redirect all by default
location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# Add the exception
location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        try_files $uri =404;
}
```

`/etc/nginx/sites-available/exmaple.jp.conf`

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name example.jp;

        # Include certbot configuration
        include snippets/certbot.conf;
}

server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

        (snip)
}
```

With this,

- Access to `http://example.jp/.well-known/acme-challenge/(any)` will check if the file exists
- All accesses other than `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` will be redirected to HTTPS

## Issue a certificate

Request a certificate. Certbot will ask for your email address and agreement confirmation to generate the account information.

```console
$ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot/ -d example.jp

## nginx configuration

For more details, read [the official guide to configure HTTPS servers](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html).

### Security enhancement

When using Certbot with the installer option (e.g. --nginx), it automatically takes care of this enhancement. With webroot method, this file has to be made manually.  
Refer: [options-ssl-nginx.conf](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/_internal/tls_configs/options-ssl-nginx.conf)

Add `/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf`

```nginx
ssl_session_cache shared:le_nginx_SSL:10m;
ssl_session_timeout 1440m;
ssl_session_tickets off;

ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

ssl_ciphers "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384";
```

Generate `/etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem`

```console
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem 2048
```

- You may find the command with 2048 just after the 'dhparam', but that will not save the file as you expect. The numbits (number) MUST BE the last option.
See [OpenSSL official document](https://docs.openssl.org/3.0/man1/openssl-dhparam/) for more details.

The file should look like this.

```plaintext
-----BEGIN DH PARAMETERS-----
MIIBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
(snip)
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBAg==
-----END DH PARAMETERS-----
```

### Add SSL/TLS configurations

Swap the snakeoil certificate for testing to proper configurations in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/exmaple.jp.conf`

```nginx
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name example.jp;

        # Include certbot configuration
        include snippets/certbot.conf;
}

server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

        # Include SSL/TLS configurations
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.jp/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.jp/privkey.pem;
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

        server_name example.jp;
        (snip)
}
```

## Revoking certificate

Certbot renews certificates automatically. If you want to stop using the certificate, [revoke it](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#revoking-certificates).

```console
sudo certbot revoke --cert-name example.jp
```
